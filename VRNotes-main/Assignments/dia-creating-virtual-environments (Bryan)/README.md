# WEEK03: Virtual Environments

This assignment allows us to get familiar with creating virtual environments in a WebXR-based application primarily using the BabylonJS framework.

Your goal is to get further acquainted with the BabylonJS framework by creating a simple virtual environment scene. It is a fairly straightforward exercise to complete, but the idea is to get you familiar with interacting with the framework. It is not a lot of code so do make an effort to understand every line of code and pick up any missing knowledge (e.g., TypeScript) as necessary.

Remember that no matter what tech stack you choose in your Team Project, the Individual Programming Assessment still expects you to have a working knowledge in TypeScript, BabylonJS to create a WebXR app.

# Tasks to complete in this lab

We will similarly follow the spirit of TDD (Test-Driven Development) in this lab. The tests are already written for you, and you will need to write the code to make the tests pass.

You will notice that the tests from the previous assignment are still there. This is because we are building on top of the previous assignment. This is to encourage you to do things progressively, and at the same time, simulate real DevOps where the tests are always cumulative. Passing new tests should not interfere with the success of previous tests, fostering a continuous development experience.

Do note that a proper TDD process in a "real" production team is much more than what we're doing here. If you wish to learn more about TDD, [Siggiqui's book](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-test-driven-development/9781098106461/) may be a good read and is available in the SIT library. However, this DIA module is not focused on software engineering (SE), so we will leave this topic here. That being said, giving some thought into your own team's SE processes is time worth spending, especially in your larger team sizes. This is also the reason why the assessment has a minor assessment component on SE.

Goes without saying that reading the test files will help you understand what you need to do.

## Testing and Submission

For testing, perform the usual:
- `npm install` to install all the dependencies
- `npm test` to run the test files

For submission, it is similarly just a matter of committing (and pushing) your changes. The tests will be run automatically when you submit your solution.
