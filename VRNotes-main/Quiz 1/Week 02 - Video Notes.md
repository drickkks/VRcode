# Evaluating Immersive Experiences
[Discussion Link](https://github.com/orgs/sit-dia/discussions/5)

## 1. Evaluation-first approach
Products are primarily built for the users, not to satisfy the developers. Thus, the quality of the product needs to be evaluated at an early stage in the development lifecycle.

Test Driven Development (TDD): Write test cases FIRST, then write code, refactor code, repeat until all test cases are satisfied.

### What is immersion?
Immersion: "a deep mental involvement in an activity"
Split into two categories: immersion as system properties & immersion in user experiences
Measuring Immersion: depends on the category 

## 2. Immersion as system properties
Immersion (as system properties): "the specifications of the system that produces immersive experiences"
Can be 'measured' by looking at the specs sheet/technical qualities of XR devices
Can also be 'measured' by the software itself - e.g. graphical fidelity, how realistic the AI is, interaction controls(like finger tracking)

## 3. Immersion as user experiences
Immersion (as user experiences): "mixture of psychological and physiological constructs"
Can be measured using experiential constructs like: Presence, Flow, Cybersickness

### 3.1 Presence
Presence: "the feeling of being there"

#### Dimensions of Presence:
- Physical Presence: "the sense of being physically relocated to the virtual space"
- Social Presence: "the sense of being around other virtual beings"
Presence can vary from person to person: having high degrees of openness and extroversion tends to lead to higher presence
- Perceptions of the degree of environmental interaction
- Perceived fidelity and realism of the simulated environment

#### Measuring Presence
- Subjective Data (used more):
	- Self reporting questionnaires
		- Igroup Presence Questionnaire (IPQ)
			- Segregates Presence into 3 parts:
				- Spatial Presence: "the feeling of physical existence in the virtual space"
				- Involvement: "how captivated one is in the virtual world"
				- Experienced Realism/Realness: "how real the virtual world feels compared to the real world"
	- Interviews
- Objective Data
- Mix of both

### 3.2 Flow
Flow: "the mental state of extreme positive engagement, such that a person loses their self-consciousness"

#### Dimensions of Flow:
1. Clear goals, with immediate feedback
	- Feedback as to how progress to those goals are going (e.g. cycling, every push of the pedals drives a person a fixed distance closer)
2. Challenges that match a person's skill level
3. Complete concentration
4. Loss of self consciousness
5. Sense of control
6. Effortlessness
7. Transformation of time
8. Autotelic experience (intrinsic motivation, doing something because the person wants to)

#### Measuring Flow
- Subjective Data
	- Questionnaires
		- Flow State Scale & Flow State Scale 2,
			- Flow Short Scale (for shorter experiences)
				- Consolidates 8 flow dimensions into 3
					- Overall Flow
					- Absorption by Activity
					- Fluency of Performance

### 3.3 Cybersickness
Cybersickness: "symptoms of sickness due to cyber activities"
Cybersickness symptoms: Nausea, Dizziness, Disorientation, more physical discomforts...
Reducing Cybersickness: try to match the interactions of the real world as much as possible to a person's view of the virtual environment in a device

#### Measuring Cybersickness
- Subjective Data
	- Questionnaires: Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ), Virtual Reality Sickness Questionnaire (VRSQ), Cybersickness Questionnaire (CSQ)
		- Grouped into categories
			- Oculomotor(Eyes) Symptoms
			- Disorientation Symptoms
	- Qualitative Think-Aloud Data
- Objective Data
	- Skin conductance sensors (measure sweat)
	- Heart rate sensors
	- Electromyography (EMG), for face muscles

## 4. Affordances
Affordances: "the relationship between the properties of an object and the capabilities of an agent that determines how the system is used"
E.g. humans have hands that can curl around stuff, door knobs have small rounds surfaces that are about the size of a human hand -> a human may tend to curl their hand around a door knob

With regards to XR, some objects have very well defined affordances in the real world (people generally know how to hold a cup), but in XR, it depends on for the system/object is implemented (perhaps the programmers did not allow for cups to be picked up)
