## Question 1

Runkeeper is a popular mobile app that tracks your running, walking, cycling, and other fitness activities. It presents the data in a typical social mobile app interface, allowing you to view your progress over time and share your accomplishments with friends. During the fitness activity, you can also view several real-time metrics such as distance, pace, and time overlaid on a 2D map view of your current location.

## Question 2

Pragmata is an upcoming game set in a dystopian future where you control a space-suited character exploring a desolate cityscape.

Question 6 options:
- implement GUI elements to present clear goals for the user to attain at every point of the commuting experience
- implement real-walking locomotion (tracking actual walking in a room-scale setting) instead of the current walking-in-place locomotion
- implement mechanics to structure the commuting experience akin to completing progressively challenging levels in a game setting
- implement teleportation locomotion instead of the current walking-in-place locomotion
- increase the visual fidelity of the graphics with custom physically based rendering shaders
- add AI-driven human characters with realistic behaviors in the simulation

## Question 7
What sort of affordance will most likely occur when you strap on vive trackers on the hands and feet for an experienced VR user in a VR commuting simulator application with walking as the main interaction?

Question 7 options:
- The user will reach out for a vive controller to use the thumbstick to navigate in the virtual environment
- The user will consciously use only the hands in his/her own way to navigate in the virtual environment
- The user will consciously use both the hands and feet in his/her own way to navigate in the virtual environment
- The user will perform a natural walking action with the whole body to navigate in the virtual environment
- The user will consciously use only the feet in his/her own way to navigate in the virtual environment

## Question 8

What dimension(s) can you change to achieve this?

Question 8 options:
- Distance between the lenses and the physical display 
- Width of the physical display
- Height of the physical display
- Eye relief
- IPD between the lenses
- Focal length of the lenses

## Question 9

In designing an HMD, you want to expand the vertical FOV.

What dimension(s) can you change to achieve this?

Question 9 options:
- Width of the physical display
- IPD between the lenses
- Focal length of the lenses
- Height of the physical display
- Distance between the lenses and the physical display 
- Eye relief

## Question 10

In the schematic HMD diagram, where is the IPD?

MISSING IMAGE

Question 10 options:
- c
- e
- f
- b
- a
- d

## Question 11

In the schematic HMD diagram, which value(s) will be changed if d was changed, in order to still maintain a correctly projected image that fully utilizes the display. Assume that the HMD hardware and the user wearing the HMD cannot be changed.

MISSING IMAGE

Question 11 options:
- f
- a
- c
- e
- b

## Question 12

Question 12 options:
- View frustum is horizontally asymmetric only
- View frustum is both vertically and horizontally asymmetric
- View frustum is vertically asymmetric only
- View frustum is both vertically and horizontally symmetric

## Question 13

## Question 15

In your WebXR typescript-based app, you want to enable a new "npm run commit" command to run on the command line in your app directory. When run, this new command will build and commit+push latest changes to GitHub.

Name the file in your project directory you should amend to make this happen.

`package.json`

## Question 16

You introduced a new "/entities" directory containing new source files for your Babylon.js project. To adhere to good programming practices, which file should you modify to reflect this?

- The field of view will be enlarged
- This is ideal for a uniform perception across both eyes to reduce cybersickness symptoms
- This results in a lack of depth perception
- The alignment across both eyes will reduce visual anomalies like ghosting or flickering.

## Question 18

MISSING IMAGE

Question 18 options:

When running this code, we are unable to see the textures on the skybox, but we know that the textures are correctly loaded.

Which line needs to be fixed (refer to the line numbers on the left gutter of the code snippet) in order to see the textures?

`5`

Replace the entire line you identified with the correct code, with only the required changes reflected from the original text. Write this entire line in the next text box.

`skyboxMaterial.backFaceCulling = false;`

## Question 19

Match the optimal scene construction approach based on the requirements listed in the question.

Question 19 options:

- (`1`) Develop a VR application for training astronauts for space missions on unexplored planets, including simulating zero-gravity locomotion, driving rovers and examining mineral samples. Accurate vehicular operation and plausible hand interactions with the environment are crucial for the training experience.
- (`1`) Develop a VR application for training medical students on surgical procedures on simulated patients, including tasks such as making incisions, suturing wounds, and manipulating surgical instruments. Realistic hand interactions with equipment and accurate representation of anatomical structures are crucial for the training experience.
- (`2`) Develop a VR application to offer virtual house tours for potential buyers. The objective is to provide users with a sense of scale similar to viewing a real house. The only interaction involves navigating around the house at predetermined locations. Your company requires quick turnaround times to produce new tours for each house listed on your website.
