# Development Tools
[Discussion Link](https://github.com/orgs/sit-dia/discussions/7)
## The Tools
### 1. Unity
- Is a public company
- Uses a component-based architecture
- Easy to create high-quality simulations or games
- Can be deployed to nearly any platform
- Has project templates for AR and VR

### 2. Unreal Engine
- Massive, feature-heavy
- Private company
- Component-based
- Has visual scripting, but also supports C++
- Good for making high-quality content with large teams
- The goto software when high-quality graphics are desired

### 3. A-Frame
- Is a JavaScript library
- Designed to be highly accessible to new developers
- Extensible to allow experienced developers to create highly complex VR experiences
- Web-based, so only builds for the web
- Held back by the immersion that is limited by the system (web browsers)
- Anyone with a browser will be able to experience XR creations (accessibility to users & developers)
- Open source
- The library creates custom HTML tags to be used in code
 
### 4. BabylonJS
- Is a JavaScript library
- Has supporting tools like Playground to allow for quick testing
- Has in-built rendering and physics libraries, focuses on performance more than A-Frame
- Large and active community
- Open source, fully supports WebXR
- Typescript is the default, not JavaScript

### 5. WebXR
- Is a set of open APIs that standardizes how XR apps are made for the web
- has support for different devices, gamepads, AR and more

### 6. OpenXR
- Is a C++ library, made by Khronos (the OpenGL & Vulkan people)
- Basically what WebXR is doing, but for native platforms instead of the web
- Is more specific with regard to deployment platforms
- Usually only needed if unique, novel features are necessary

### 7. Choice Factors when Selecting Tools
- E.g clients have Meta Quest Pro systems, used in medical training environments -> Unreal Engine
- E.g. Crowdsource camera footage through an AR game -> have as many users as possible -> BabylonJS

#### Non Functional Considerations of Tools
- Cost 
- Stability
- Customizability/extensibility
- Community + Support
- Learning Opportunities (does the tool align with learning objectives as a developer?)

## Why WebXR + BabylonJS
- End products will be more accessible to users, accessibility leads to adoption, leads to more feedback, leads to a better product
- Large, active developer community
- Accessibility to developers, will give prototypes longevity
- Nuanced technicalities, can help in designing more unique experiences
- Applied learning experience
